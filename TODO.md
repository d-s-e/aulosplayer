## TODO list and other ideas for aulosplayer and related software

### aulosplayer:
 * manual or automatic reconnect if one of the servers is not available
 * handling of aulos shared playlists
 * handling of serverside playlists


### mpd:
 * enable default null device as fallback
   (otherwise mpd stops playback when all other outputs are disabled)
 * evaluate alsa config to allow mixing
